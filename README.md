# Yacht

This version of Yacht is based on the game of the same title in the Nintendo Switch title **51 Worldwide Games**.

## How to play

The aim of the game is to get the highest score after all 12 rounds have been completed.

### Order of play

- Each round, all five dice are rolled up to three times.
- Between these rolls, any number of the dice can be set aside from the next roll to preserve their number, or brought back into the mix for the next roll.
- After each roll, the values of the dice may be used to add a score to one of the 12 categories. After the third roll, a category must be chosen.
- Each category may only be chosen once.
